      <p>Even if you’re not a programmer, you’ve probably heard of HTML. It’s the most fundamental markup language and it’s been around since the nineties. What you’re maybe not as familiar with is CSS. It’s an element of programming that’s just as important, and along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the three main cornerstones of technologies for the web. But just what is CSS, how does it work, and why is it so critical? Read on and learn.</p>
      <h2 class="add-shadow">What Is CSS?</h2>
      <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language. Think “look and feel” when you think CSS.</p>
      <h2 class="change-align">Why Is CSS so important?</h2>
      <p>You’ll notice quite a few differences between the two when it comes to overall presentation. With CSS, you see a change in font, font size, and font color. You also see a change in the format of the buttons and get an added blue background behind them. Each of these elements are possible because of cascading style sheets. As a user, which looks more enticing? It’s pretty easy to see why CSS is so crucial.</p>
